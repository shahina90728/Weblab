<p>The Department of Computer Application at Ilahia College of Engineering and Technology (ICET) offers a postgraduate Master of Computer Applications (MCA) program
. Established in 2008, the department provides a professional learning environment with a focus on both academics and practical skills. The two-year, full-time MCA program, affiliated with APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, aims to develop students into dynamic IT professionals by combining theoretical classroom instruction with practical lab sessions, workshops, industrial visits, and a final-semester project. A dedicated placement cell provides training in communication, aptitude, and reasoning skills, which has led to successful placements for graduates at reputed organizations such as Wipro, IBS, and ClaySys. The department also maintains its own library stocked with relevant books and journals, supplementing the college's central library resources. Equipped with modern computer labs, smart classrooms, and faculty guidance, the department focuses on fostering innovation, problem-solving, and professional excellence.
